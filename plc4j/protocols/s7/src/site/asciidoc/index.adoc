= S7 Protocol Java Implementation

The current version of the S7 protocol java driver is based upon Netty 4 (http://netty.io/).

As the S7 protocol running on TCP is a hierarchy of protocols, the S7 driver is implemented by providig several MessageToMessageCodec implementations, each encoding one layer of the protocol stack.

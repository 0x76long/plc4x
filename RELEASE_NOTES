Apache PLC4X (incubating) 0.1.0
===============================

This is the first official release of Apache PLC4X.
It contains drivers for the following protocols:
- Siemens S7comm (0x32)
- Beckhoff ADS
- Modbus
- EtherNet/IP

However the Siemens driver definitely is the most
mature driver, the rest should be treated experimental.

New Features
------------

PLC4X-29	[S7] Implement PDU Fragmentation
PLC4X-39	Extend the Edgent integration with the new Subscription features of PLC4X

Most drivers should be treated experimental and are not near production ready.
The S7 driver is probably the furthest implemented and tested driver and hereby can be 
considered to be the most mature.

PLC4X-20	Jacoco doesn't seem to be working at all
PLC4X-21	Code coverage doesn't seem to work
PLC4X-47	S7 driver silently ignores surplus ReadRequestItems

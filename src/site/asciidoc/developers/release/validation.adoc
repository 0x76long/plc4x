== Validating a staged release

TIP: On MacOS and Linux the first 4 steps can be automated. For details please read the section about tooling after this chapter.

1. Download all staged artifacts under the url specified in the release vote email into a directory we'll now call `download-dir`.
2. Verify the signature is correct:
Additional Apache tutorial on how to verify downloads can be found http://www.apache.org/info/verification.html[here].
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
gpg --verify apache-plc4x-{current-full-version}-source-release.zip.asc apache-plc4x-#{current-full-version}-source-release.zip
----
+
3. Check if the check is successful.
4. Check if the signature references an Apache email address.
5. Verify the SHA512 hashes:
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
shasum -a512 apache-plc4x-{current-full-version}-source-release.zip
----
+
6. Unzip the archive:
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
unzip apache-plc4x-{current-full-version}-source-release.zip
----
+
7. Verify the existence of `LICENSE`, `NOTICE, `README`, `RELEASE_NOTES` files in the extracted source bundle.
8. Verify the content of `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, `README`, `RELEASE_NOTES files in the extracted source bundle.
** (Especially pay attention to the year in the `NOTICE` file if this is the first release of the year)
9. [RM] Verify the staged source README, RELEASE_NOTE files correspond to those in the extracted source bundle.
10. [RM] Run RAT externally to ensure there are no surprises.
** TODO: Document this.
11. Search for `SNAPSHOT` references:
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
find . -type f -name 'pom.xml' -exec grep -l "SNAPSHOT" {} \;
----
+
12. Build the project according to the information in the README.md file.
** [RM] Build the project with all `with-xyz` profiles and tests enabled and an empty maven local repo: by appendng `-Dmaven.repo.local=../.m2`.

=== Release Tooling

In the `tools` directory we have a little script that can help downloading and checking the hashes and signatures automatically.

In order to execute this, please change directories into the projects base directory and execute the following command:

[subs="attributes"]
----
tools/download_staged_release.sh {current-full-version} 1
----

This will download all the files into a directory: `downloaded-plc4x-{current-full-version}1`.

After that it will calculate the SHA512 hash and compare it with the staged hash.

Last not least it will validate the PGP key and print out some information on it.

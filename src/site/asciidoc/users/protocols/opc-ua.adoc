=== More details on OPC UA

https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-ua/[OPC UA]
The OPC Unified Architecture (UA), released in 2008, is a platform independent service-oriented architecture that integrates all the functionality of the individual OPC Classic specifications into one extensible framework.

This multi-layered approach accomplishes the original design specification goals of:

* Functional equivalence: all COM OPC Classic specifications are mapped to UA
* Platform independence: from an embedded micro-controller to cloud-based infrastructure
* Secure: encryption, authentication, and auditing
* Extensible: ability to add new features without affecting existing applications
* Comprehensive information modeling: for defining complex information

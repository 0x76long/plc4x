=== Current Releases

==== 0.3.0 Official https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/incubator/plc4x/0.3.0-incubating/apache-plc4x-incubating-0.3.0-source-release.zip[source release] [ https://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/plc4x/0.3.0-incubating/apache-plc4x-incubating-0.3.0-source-release.zip.sha512[SHA512] ] [ https://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/plc4x/0.3.0-incubating/apache-plc4x-incubating-0.3.0-source-release.zip.asc[ASC] ]

===== New Features

- Object PLC Mapping (OPM) now has a Alias Registry to allow
  variable substitution at runtime and write support
- New module `plc-scraper` for applications that have to
  scrape a lot of sps fields with high frequency
- New integration `apache-karaf` to enable plc4j in a karaf
  runtime environment

===== Incompatible changes

- The 'plc4j-core' module has been merged into 'plc4j-api'.
  So there is no 'plc4j-core' module anymore. Just remove that
  dependency.
- The driver artifact names have changed so if you were using
  a `plc4j-protocol-{name}` you now need to change this to
  `plc4j-driver-{name}`

===== Bug Fixes

- Fixing dependency to the wrap url-handler
- When receiving responses with more than 512 byte, the IsoOnTcp protocol doesn't work
- When the last item in a request is a DINT, the DefaultS7MessageProcessor dies
- Write operations seem to fail
- Fixed a Bug where S7 was not able to read arrays.
